2.9.3
(1) SECURITY FIX: FD_SETSIZE overflow DOS
(2) SSL support can now be used if configured with --with-ssl
    SSL connection is done by passing -s
    ex.  /quote conn -s ircs.server
    Note:  this is only partially secure since SSL is only supported
    outgoing.

2.9.2
(1) Added flush to logging
(2) General code changes to fix compiling on some compilers
(3) Fixed problems binding to listening address

2.9.1
(1) SECURITY FIX: password check, was only letting incorrect passwords in
(2) Fixed IP binding on listen

2.9.0
(1) Added trailing newlines to log records
(2) Added extra error handling on accepting connections
(3) Fixed buffer overflow in getnickuserhost (reported by Leon Juranic)
(4) Added extra check for gethostbyname2
(5) Made password check more thorough
(6) Fixed ipv6 dns resolving to random ipv4

2.8.9
(1) Fixed backspace security flaw (reported by Yak)
(2) Fixed compile errors related to compound statements
(3) Rewrote logic of /vip command
(4) Rewrote docked session listing code

2.8.8
(1) Added support for setting a specific IP to listen on 
    (listen <[host:]port> [maxusers])
(2) Enhanced bncsetup to use new conf format and new question to handle
    specific host entering.
(3) Changed the Makefile to list libraries last, some crypt libraries
    predefined their own main function which prevented compiling.
(4) Reorganized the connection code to fix a bug where a user gets
    disconnected while connecting to an irc server.
(5) Socket length was not being set before accept. (Thanks chris)
(6) Removed old hack code for systems that do not support snprintf.
(7) Increased error checking in recv code.
(8) Better parsing of messages
(9) Server buffers always cleared when connecting to a new server.
(10) Initial IPv6 support.  Added -6 option to the CONN command
     (i.e. CONN -6 irc.ipv6.org) which is only necessary on ambigious
     addresses or when connecting via dns.
(11) Listen host can be specified in conf as an ipv6 address by putting 
     the address in []'s (i.e. LISTEN [2000:610:0:23::]:6669)

2.8.6
(1) Bnc now lists all docked sessions
(2) Rewrote the send/recv code
(3) Implemented non-blocking sockets
(4) Fixed a problem with bnc not binding to vhost when specified by IP
       instead of dns

2.8.4
(1) a quick change added to conf.c by moomoomoo to fix a major bug and tide
	us over until the 3.0.0 version is ready for public release.

2.8.2
(1) Coded in channel watching code for docking.
(2) Coded a new line parsing system
(3) Coded a new system for the client lists, maybe it will fix some bugs
(4) implemented docking,  still very beta though  /detach password
      /resume FD password
(5) rewrote some of the inner workings, hope this fixed some bugs.
(6) rewrote config file format, now uses real words (listen xxx) read
      example.conf for details. Old format will still work.


2.6.4
(1) Coded my own Atoi trying to solve some weird bug where ppl would put a
      number in there conf file and get completely different results.
(2) Moved around the identwd code, added some bug fixes.  Should stop a
      crash bug on users on an nfs system.
(3) Fixed a shutdown bug related to clients that leave before bnc knows who
      they are by ignoring SIGPIPE.
(4) Added a feature to try to guess why the SELECTERR happens, maybe we
      won't get as many shutdowns related to that.
(5) Changed bncsetup, little more able to live if you don't have dialog
(6) BNC now watches your nickname, experimental code to help developing irc
      docking, maybe someday you can leave your nick on the net while you
      leave.
(7) Wow, some people do read the README file, updated it mildly to reflect
      current program status.

2.6.2
(1) Fixed delinking bug that was bouncing cpu usage to 100% (ick)
(2) made bnc able to handle commands, while on irc.
(3) cleanup, memory reductions
(4) added BMSG as a test level command, don't expect much from it at this
      stage
(5) added PRE as a test level command. (prefixed raw echo)

2.6.0
(1) Added more verbose /quote help
(2) Changed MAIN, now can be used to bypass PASS if your superpass is
      correct.
(3) Motd is now only showed when user is fully connected, and supervisors
      don't have to see it.
(4) Help system no longer shows admin commands, unless your connected as a
      supervisor
(5) DIE and BDIE bug fixes.
(6) Changed socket and log printing system.  replaced a log point that was
      not working correctly.
(7) Changed handlers for socket data, reducing structure handling code.
(8) Fixed a lot of potential string based overflows.  Reduced memory
      requirements for users.
(9) Changed handlers for pre-connected commands, code speedup and beginnings
      for planned future expansions.
(10) Changed configure parts, increasing portability?
(11) Fixed up the autocon feature, now works when only PASS:SERVER 
(12) Added KEEPALIVE to command list, returns you to bnc when an irc server
       closes you.
(13) Changed BWHO status routine.
(14) Changed password parser, recoded autoconn routines, removed autoconn
       memory wasters from the client.
(15) Recoded main parser, more effected USER handler, reduced memory
       requirements for USER in the process.
(16) Updated my e-mail address everywhere I see it. Don't you hate how hard
      it is to hold the same e-mail for a long time :/
2.4.8
(1) Fixed a potential buffer overflow
(2) Reduced memory requirements in the process of removing the overflow :)
    Thanks go to barubary for helping me plan a replacement fifo system.
(3) Added partially connected listing to BWHO
(4) Added killing for partially connected ppl with BKILL
(5) Added QUIT command during connection phase
(6) Fixed a little bug in ./bncsetup

2.4.6
(1) Recoded encryption, if pass starts with + then it is encrypted, if not
      then it is plaintext.
(2) Added/recoded bncsetup dialog based script, for ease of .conf creation
(3) Made /quote BWHO show a little bit more info about who is connected
(4) Changed a few prints to help logging, exits are now logged.
(5) Added motd support
(6) Added /quote HELP
(7) Added /quote IDENT to let you change your ident if you have identwd.

2.4.4
(1) New readme file, made example.conf easier to understand
(2) Fixed that annoying Bind error thing when bnc is killed.
(3) Moved some large varibles out of stack space for speed and securety.
(4) Added IP allow lists, to keep out unwanted users (conf file 'A' line)
      Thanks to White Dragon for this
(5) Added encrypted passwords in config file.  Thanks again White Dragon
(6) Added dynamic Idents on servers that run Identwd. enabled by putting
      W:1 inside config file.  Thanks again White Dragon (gee starting to
      sound repetative) Also note identwd is coded by White Dragon.

2.4.3
(1) Fixed bug that cropped up in mirc hanging on a /server bnc port pass
(2) Fixed all the bugs that were hiding behind the bug above, which unveiled
      crashing problems when connecting to an irc server.
(3) Made a ./configure script to help portability, now compiles just fine
      on sunos, BSD and linux.  Haven't tested it on AIX, please if somebody
      compiles it on AIX, drop me a word.
2.4.2:
(1) Fixed various problems with Vhosts.
(2) Fixed unusual crash bug.
(3) Added commands VDF and VN.
      VDF switches Vhost back to the config files default Vhost.
      VN  switches the Vhost to the systems default bypassing config file.
(4) Added more verbose output to VIP.
(5) Secured up printed data with absolute sizes instead of wasting cpu doing 
      a second size compare.
