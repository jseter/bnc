1.INTRODUCTION
	BNC is a simple program designed to Proxy irc sessions.
  It is user configurable using the file bnc.conf and includes
  multi-user, passwords, and other basic necessities.

2.COMPILATION
	I would tell you how to un-tar/gz this file, but your
  reading this so why would you need help :-)
	To compile bnc simply type:
  gcc -o bnc bnc.c

3.CONFIGURATION
	The configuration file give BNC the nessesary info to
  process such as the port to bind to and what port to request
  when a conn is requested, also passwords and maxusers.

4.RUNNING
  type:
  advbnc

	As you can guess i succeeded in making it do the nohup bnc&
  by itself.

5.CLIENT SIDE
	When using various clients you connect to the server in
  which the daemon is ran.  In ircii and other clients you will 
  have to give your password by typing /quote pass <password> to
  continue, in Mirc you can simply /server bnc.server.net port pass
  to connect.  Once your pass is ok'ed you can tell it to connect
  to an irc server by typing /quote conn irc.server.net [port].

6.GNU
	Yeah you know how this works so just realize this is gnu.
